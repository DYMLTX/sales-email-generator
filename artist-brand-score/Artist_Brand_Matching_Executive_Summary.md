## What Worked vs. What Didn't

### Highly Predictive Features ✓

1. **Gender Distribution** (r=0.89)
   - Most powerful single predictor
   - Brands with defined gender targets aligned well

2. **Income Brackets** (r=0.84)
   - Clear correlation between artist audience income and brand targeting
   - Premium brands matched with higher-income artist audiences

3. **Age Ranges** (r=0.78)
   - Strong predictor when ranges overlapped
   - Millennial-focused brands scored highest

4. **Consumer Attributes → Industry Mapping**
   - "Moms" → Family brands (High correlation)
   - "Coffee Houses" → QSR brands (Moderate correlation)
   - "Dog Owners" → Pet brands (When available)

### Less Predictive Features ✗

1. **Geographic Alignment** (r=0.001)
   - Most brands target nationally, limiting geographic differentiation
   - Regional preferences didn't significantly impact scores

2. **Ethnicity Matching** (r=0.31)
   - Many brands target "all ethnicities" 
   - Limited variability in brand data

3. **Granular Consumer Attributes**
   - Niche interests (e.g., "drummers", "ice skating") had few brand matches
   - Over-indexing on specific behaviors less valuable than demographics
