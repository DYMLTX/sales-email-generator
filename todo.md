# MAX.Live Automated Sales Email System - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build an automated email outreach system to connect MAX.Live with potential brand sponsors for live music show sponsorships. Using SET.live technology, brands can sponsor artists' live shows where they receive:
- On-stage screen visibility throughout the performance
- Artist verbal acknowledgments and endorsements
- Fan contact data from interactive registrations (contests, giveaways)
- Real-time audience engagement during the show

The system will generate personalized emails emphasizing the unique value of live show sponsorships vs. traditional content sponsorships.

## Live Show Sponsorship Value Props
- **Authentic Moments**: Brands integrated into the live experience, not interrupting it
- **Captive Audience**: Fans are fully engaged during shows, not scrolling past ads
- **Artist Endorsement**: Genuine artist appreciation creates positive brand association
- **Data Collection**: Real contact info from fans actively participating in contests
- **Geographic Targeting**: Sponsor shows in specific markets/venues
- **Measurable ROI**: Track registrations, engagement, and post-show actions

## Target Audience
- Brand Marketing Directors/VPs at companies with:
  - Consumer-facing products/services
  - Target demographics that attend live music events (Gen Z, Millennials)
  - Previous experiential marketing initiatives
  - Budget for sponsorships/partnerships
  - Interest in authentic, non-intrusive advertising
