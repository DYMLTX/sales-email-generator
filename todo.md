## Key Considerations

1. **HubSpot Limitations**: Since HubSpot doesn't support bulk marketing emails via API, we'll use transactional emails for personalized outreach
2. **Data Sync Options**: Support both file upload and Google Sheets sync as requested
3. **Scalability**: Design for handling thousands of personalized emails daily
4. **Cost Optimization**: Implement caching and efficient API usage to minimize costs
5. **Security**: Ensure all credentials are stored in Secret Manager
6. **Compliance**: Build with GDPR and CAN-SPAM compliance from the start
